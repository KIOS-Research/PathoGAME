about=PathoGAME is an interactive QGIS plugin that turns the task of finding contaminants into an exciting game. Its main goal is to assist users in accurately identifying where contaminants are located. The game uses the benchmark water network `Anytown`. `ImportEpanetInpFiles` QGIS plugin was used to convert EPANET input files into shapefiles. In the first level, you have the assistance of 10 sensors (cyan color) that can detect tbe contamination (red color) within the water network. In the second level, the number of sensors is reduced to 5, and in the final level, you only have 3 sensors. Additionally, each level provides a heart help, which grants an extra sensor placed randomly. The contamination's location is randomized. The user is presented with two options to select the correct contamination location at each level.
